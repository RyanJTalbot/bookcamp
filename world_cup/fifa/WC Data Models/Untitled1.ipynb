Parameters to an estimator’s constructor are stored unmodified as attributes on the estimator instance, and conventionally start with an alphabetic character and end with an alphanumeric character. Each estimator’s constructor parameters are described in the estimator’s docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not use parameters in the statistical sense, where parameters are values that specify a model and can be estimated from data. What we call parameters might be what statisticians call hyperparameters to the model: aspects for configuring model structure that are often not directly learnt from data. However, our parameters are also used to prescribe modeling operations that do not affect the learnt model, such as n_jobs for controlling parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about the parameters of a meta-estimator, we may also be including the parameters of the estimators wrapped by the meta-estimator. Ordinarily, these nested parameters are denoted by using a double underscore (__) to separate between the estimator-as-parameter and its parameter. Thus clf = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)) has a deep parameter base_estimator__max_depth with value 3, which is accessible with clf.base_estimator.max_depth or clf.get_params()['base_estimator__max_depth'].\n",

Any public attribute stored on an estimator instance is required to begin with an alphabetic character and end in a single underscore if it is set in fit or partial_fit. These are what is documented under an estimator’s Attributes documentation. The information stored in attributes is usually either: sufficient statistics used for prediction or transformation; transductive outputs such as labels_ or embedding_; or diagnostic data, such as feature_importances_. Common attributes are listed below.\n",

For example, decomposition.PCA is constructed with an n_components parameter. From this, together with other parameters and the data, PCA estimates the attribute n_components_.\n",
