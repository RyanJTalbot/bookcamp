    "# Random Forest applied to LendingClub data set\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). We try to create a model to predict the risk of lending money to someone given a wide range of credit related data. We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are what the columns in the data set represent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values \"credit_card\", \"debt_consolidation\", \"educational\", \"major_purchase\", \"small_business\", and \"all_other\").\n",
    "- int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.\n",
    "- installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.\n",
    "- log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.\n",
    "- dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).\n",
    "- fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.\n",
    "- days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.\n",
    "- revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).\n",
    "- revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).\n",
    "- inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.\n",
    "- delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.\n",
    "- pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).\n",
    "- not.fully.paid: The quantity of interest for classification - whether the borrower paid back the money in full or not\n",
